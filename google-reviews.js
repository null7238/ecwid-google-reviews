He asked me to repeat my question and said we are a fish store. Then asked me why I'm wondering this and that he's never been asked this question. I told him that some store many have few selections of fishes on site and that they may only have supplies on hand. And I told him that his response was super rude and that I will not be coming there ever and he hung up the phone on me!!

Enough parking space in front of the store. Has inspiring display set ups. Fair pricing.\n\nI had a good talk with the store founder and it is evident that he is passionate with the hobby. It reflects very well by how the set ups are done.\n\nThe fish selection is great. Live aquatic plants are also looking well. A good selection is present and available.\n\nI found this store by many recommendations by other customers they had on facebook groups, and I am glad to have visited it myself.\n\nWe took home 2 juvenile chocolate orandas, 4 thorn nerite snails, and some salvinias. It was all well packed as we mentioned that we are not from Winnipeg. He placed them in a secure and thick styro box. It was a great gesture that was above and beyond. We had bought more higher priced fish before from a different shop and even when we say we are travelling more than an hour, it was simply placed in a bigger bag. No box, no double bag.\n\nThis is a shop that would like to keep their sold fish alive and enjoyable to their buyers. I hope more will support businesses like this.","picture":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUbG5v-SbzLjLVWvKdaOBRgyORBd42I8uTWlZ-nvlS5oSuKex14sQ=s40-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100","time":"2 weeks ago"},{"title":"Kevin Cook","profileHref":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103187404826194315365?hl=en-US&ved=1t:31294&ictx=111","rating":"5","reviewText":"Great staff super friendly","picture":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocIlRe0ZGjOwgbWRZ93mQNAen4dREV-4fJZeJClKLRCiFdoVsA=s40-c-rp-mo-br100","time":"2 weeks ago"},{"title":"Gianna Donnelly","profileHref":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117015004624543399076?hl=en-US&ved=1t:31294&ictx=111","rating":"5","reviewText":"Amazing service!!","picture":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocLqOx4LwKoSKNphtH1tQz2XsFD-gWBA5PxHcIPvPcWqK8Zm=s40-c-rp-mo-br100","time":"3 weeks ago"},{"title":"Samuel Quizon","profileHref":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114723182905081533908?hl=en-US&ved=1t:31294&ictx=111","rating":"5","reviewText":"Store is very organized, and fish tanks are very clear!

The prices were fabulous. Highly recommended.

The owner is personable, takes his time to identify your needs and helps you to make an informed purchase.

I've also had a custom 'all-in-one' saltwater system built from him including a custom designed power-coated stand.
