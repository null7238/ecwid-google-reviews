I was disgusted at the lack of responsibility they are willing to take. Just blame the customer. Absolutely sickened by the horrible attitude I received. I took pictures of the entire conversation if anyone questions what transpired. BUT I do take some of the blame as I did put trust in this shop. They have now lost several customers. If there was zero starts they'd get it.","picture":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUdraH514fn_eGkg_8duGfLllv75bbkkLhk4OFuWMn01kzH7VDu=s40-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100","time":"a week ago"},{"title":"Anna Velasco","rating":"5","reviewText":"The cleanest aquatic shop in the city.

They have made good use of the space theyre in and we were able to use our stroller no problem which might not seem noteworthy unless youve visited some of the other fish stores in Winnipeg.\n\nHaving an actually usable website with up-to-date detailed inventory and information is huge. Prior to finding their store it felt like I was going to need to join group buys or pay for overnight shipping if I wanted a shot at getting what I wanted.\n\nMaking an effort to put names to faces and even giving our a daughter a cute little whale stuffy craft to make at home was the icing on the cake. My family was very impressed and we look forward to returning in the future.","picture":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVlOEcbCiv8nAS7F3dBwEd3EQfIW-TZ-FIJXbsA33DlsOOvPmns=s40-c-rp-mo-br100","time":"2 weeks ago"},{"title":"Kent","rating":"5","reviewText":"Just went here today for the very first time.
