I asked them if they carry hillstream loaches and the first thing they say is if I looked on their website. It felt very dismissive and an odd way to answer a simple question. It's fine to tell me you keep your website updates on stock but I don't see why anyone would lead with that if they're not being passive aggressive.\n\nThe extra annoying part is they did say they had them afterwards, so I checked their website and it said they didn't have stock. All they had was Borneo sucker loach which are not the same family as hillstream loaches, they're similar but not the same.\n\nEdit: So the owner called me back today and although I appreciate the commitment to their business I don't really appreciate being harassed for sharing my feelings. To a degree I understand not appreciating a review of their business based on a telephone conversation. That said your business is represented through all media and the phone call I received from the owner took a very unfortunate tone. Truly the oddest experience with a business I've ever had, I can empathize that their business essentially becomes their life and family but this was just a step too far.\n\nI didn't like the original conversation, I was polite with the employee, I left feedback; that's it. No need for name calling, such a weird experience. If the review was too much before it's definitely not now.\n\nEdit 2: This is just too much, provide feedback he doesn't like and he harasses and insults you. This is not healthy behavior.","picture":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVclsP2F1XQYdBv-2aKhZ5djzjcbbs9EwmyvQ2qt7p6T1g9K3fd=w36-h36-p-rp-mo-ba3-br100","time":"Edited 8 months ago"},{"title":"Russian Ras","profileHref":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117693875209446797268/reviews?hl=en","rating":"5","reviewText":"My go-to reef.
